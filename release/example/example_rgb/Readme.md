## Example of enhancing a RGB picuture

This project requires OpenCV. If you have it, you can do as follow:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

The out_fianl.bin file locating in the ./build directory is the final picture you want.

Also, the picture illustrating on the screen is the RGB picture you demand.
